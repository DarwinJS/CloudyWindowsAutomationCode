# PowerShell Core Development Environment Installer

## Design Goals
- **Universality** - This set of installation scripts has the goal of being universal and working properly on as many target OSes as possible.  Open source contributions are hoped to broaden the number of OS versions and distros that can be successfully installed to.
- **Run From Web or Local Execution** - quick and easy running from the web or copy and run local (seamless operation of either)


## Installs
- PowerShell Core (via a repo where available)
- Visual Studio Code (via a repo where available)
- Visual Studio Code PowerShell Extension (ms-vscode.PowerShell)

## Updates
If the target OS supports repos for the products (Redhat and Debian at this point) PowerShell Core and Visual Studio code can be updated via the OS package manager.  The Visual Studio Code PowerShell Extension is kept up to date by VS Code's internal package manager.
